<p>Today, I began the first day of the 5 week coding boot camp organised byt the Visiola Foundation. It was a blast! We began with a brief photo session outside the office, then we went back in to introduce ourselves and get acquainted with one another. The facilitators began by introducing themselves: miss Chinwe Ugbuja, Miss Elizabeth Wuraola Kolade and Mr. Isreal Oladejo.Then we the campers introduced ourselves and what we hope to achieve from this camp. Then we learnt the STEM Girls Chant and the STEM Song.</p>
<p>After that, we were given a brief introduction to the web and the internet by Miss Wura, as well as an introduction to HTML. We then began to learn about some of the tags under HTML and then we were given a classwork which I couldn't participate in because the laptop my seatmate and I were given was a "hanger" yesterday, lol. We were also given a take home assignment.</p>

The following is for practice sake:
<ul type="bullet">
<li>Orange</li>
<li>Pineapple</li>
<li>Banana</li>

<ol type="a">
<li>Orange</li>
<li>Pineapple</li>
<li>Banana</li>
</ol>
